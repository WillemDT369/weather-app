# Weather-app
### What
This is a consolidation exercise about the javascript we've been learning:

- A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results.
- DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests.
- Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api.
  
### Objectives
Building a weather app with some must have and nice to have features.
Must-haves:
- In the home page the user can enter the city of his/her choice (think of the right HTML elements here).
- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days.
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly.

Nice-to-haves:
- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as Chart.js.
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits.
- Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities.
- Use the API of [https://unsplash.com/](https://unsplash.com/) to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
